## Data wrangling refresher

1.  Starting from penguins, write a single piped sequence in which you:
    -   Only include penguins at Dream and Biscoe Islands

    -   Remove the year and sex variables

    -   Add a new column body_mass_kg with penguin mass converted from g to kg

    -   Rename the island variable to location

```{r}
new_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Dream", "Biscoe")) %>% 
  select(-year, -sex) %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) %>% 
  rename(location = island)
```

2.  Starting from penguins, write a single piped sequence to:
    -   Limit to Adelie penguins

    -   Remove any observations where flipper_length_mm is NA (!is.na() or drop_na)

    -   Group the data by sex

    -   Create a summary table that contains the mean, standard deviation and sample size of flipper lengths for male and female Adelie penguins.

```{r}
penguins_adelie <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(flipper_length_mm)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm), sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm), count = n())
```
